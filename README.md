<h6 align="center">I go by many names, but if we aren't friends just call me Afton or Mr. Afton. My other names are reserved for friends and close friends.
<h6 align="center">═══════
<h6 align="center">ꨄ
<h6 align="center">You may find me sitting quietly, if I am not responding I am probably offtab or Afk. I try to remember to put Afk in my name.
<h6 align="center">You are free to come sit with me, just don't cover me. I do like to see myself. Friends can do whatever.
<h5 align="center">Don't copy mine or our ponies, since we worked hard on making them..
<h6 align="center">Be mindful I can get agitated at times, so if I have iwc/iwec interact with care please.
<h6 align="center">Basic Dni critera plus most of the fnaf fandom itself. I don't like being shipped with my son... seriously why...
